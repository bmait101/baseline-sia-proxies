	abstract = {Increasingly, stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) are used to quantify trophic structure, though relatively few studies have tested accuracy of isotopic structural measures. For laboratory-raised and wild-collected plant-invertebrate food chains spanning four trophic levels we estimated nitrogen range (NR) using δ(15)N, and carbon range (CR) using δ(13)C, which are used to quantify food chain length and breadth of trophic resources respectively. Across a range of known food chain lengths we examined how NR and CR changed within and between food chains. Our isotopic estimates of structure are robust because they were calculated using resampling procedures that propagate variance in sample means through to quantified uncertainty in final estimates. To identify origins of uncertainty in estimates of NR and CR, we additionally examined variation in discrimination (which is change in δ(15)N or δ(13)C from source to consumer) between trophic levels and among food chains. δ(15)N discrimination showed significant enrichment, while variation in enrichment was species and system specific, ranged broadly (1.4‰ to 3.3‰), and importantly, propagated variation to subsequent estimates of NR. However, NR proved robust to such variation and distinguished food chain length well, though some overlap between longer food chains infers a need for awareness of such limitations. δ(13)C discrimination was inconsistent; generally no change or small significant enrichment was observed. Consequently, estimates of CR changed little with increasing food chain length, showing the potential utility of δ(13)C as a tracer of energy pathways. This study serves as a robust test of isotopic quantification of food chain structure, and given global estimates of aquatic food chains approximate four trophic levels while many food chains include invertebrates, our use of four trophic level plant-invertebrate food chains makes our findings relevant for a majority of ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific and interspecific variation in the trophic position of various consumers is central to many theories of aquatic ecosystem functioning and dynamics. In recent years, such issues have been addressed using stable N isotopes (d15N) to estimate trophic position of consumers in aquatic ecosystems. However, one needs to correct for variation in baseline d15N among sites to estimate the trophic position of any aquatic consumer using d15N. We first discuss the steps needed to select a baseline indicator in river ecosystems, where abundant foodweb isotopic data have been published but limited attention has been paid to identification of baseline organisms. We examined within-site differences in d15N among primary consumers belonging to different functional and taxonomic groups and found significant differences in d15N. Collectors were significantly enriched compared to other primary consumers.We propose scrapers as a baseline d15N indicator because they showed low d15N values and were more widely distributed than other primary consumers throughout our study sites. Using this baseline d15N, we calculated continuous estimates of trophic position of consumers (invertebrates and small fish) for our 87 river food webs. Primary consumers had a significantly lower mean trophic position (2.3) than predatory invertebrates (2.9) and fish (3.5), and these results are concordant with estimates based on traditional studies. However, trophic- position estimates of consumers (both invertebrates and fish) were highly variable across sites with standard deviations spanning up to 0.67 trophic levels, which suggested potential omnivory. Comparison of these trophic-position estimates with estimates based on mean d15N of all primary consumers combined (no targeting of scrapers as baseline indicators) suggested that use of a constrained number of groups and corrections for isotopic differences among groups when estimating baseline d15N could reduce some biases induced by the use of various functional feeding groups with variable d15N values.

Interpreting the δ15N of consumers relative to the δ15N characterizing the base of the food web provides a time-integrated measure of trophic position. We use primary consumers (trophic level 2) as baseline indicator organisms and investigate the variation in baseline δ15N values in 14 lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Values of δ15N ranged from -2 to +9‰ and varied significantly as a function of lake habitat (mean littoral = 1.6‰, pelagic = 3.1‰, profundal = 5.2‰). Stable carbon isotopic signatures (δ13C) of primary consumers decreased along this same habitat gradient (mean littoral = -23.8‰, pelagic = -28.4‰, profundal = -30.5‰). Primary consumer δ13C and a categorical lake variable explained 72\% of the variability in primary consumer δ15N. This relationship was corroborated by primary consumer δ15N and δ13C data from the literature, indicating that habitat-specific variation in baseline δ15N and δ13C is a widespread phenomenon in freshwater systems. We present a method that uses the presented baseline δ15N-δ13C relationship and the δ15N and δ13C values of the consumer to estimate trophic position; it is a method that corrects for the described variation in baseline δ15N. These results emphasize the general importance of accounting for patterns in isotopic signatures characterizing the base of the food web when inferring trophic structure using stable isotopes.},

	abstract = {Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Corson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853 USA. Institute for Ecosystem Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, New York 12545 USA The stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.

	abstract = {Stable isotope analysis provides a powerful tool to identify the energy sources which fuel consumers, to understand trophic interactions and to infer consumer trophic position (TP), an important concept that describes the ecological role of consumers in food webs. However, current methods for estimating TP using stable isotopes are limited and do not fulfil the complete potential of the isotopic approach. For instance, researchers typically use point estimates for key parameters including trophic discrimination factors and isotopic baselines, and do not explicitly include variance associated with these parameters when calculating TP. We present “tRophicPosition,” an r package incorporating a Bayesian model for the calculation of consumer TP at the population level using stable isotopes, with one or two baselines. It combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations through JAGS and statistical and graphical analyses using R. We model consumer and baseline observations using relevant statistical distributions, allowing them to be treated as random variables. The calculation of TP—a random parameter—for one baseline follows standard equations linking 15N enrichment per trophic level and the trophic position of the baseline (e.g. a primary producer or primary consumer). In the case of two baselines, a simple mixing model incorporating δ13C allows for the differentiation between two distinct sources of nitrogen, thus including heterogeneity derived from alternatives sources of δ15N. Methods currently implemented in “tRophicPosition” include loading, plotting and summarizing stable isotope data either from multiple sites and/or communities or a local assemblage; loading trophic discrimination factors from an internal database or generating them; defining and initializing a Bayesian model of TP; sampling posterior parameters; analysing, comparing and plotting posterior estimates of TP and other parameters; and calculating a parametric (non‐Bayesian) TP estimate.

	abstract = {Running waters in urbanized areas are large-scale systems of anthropogenic energy dissipation that receive effluents from point and diffuse sources, potentially inducing changes in organic matter decomposition and deposition and thus modifying river metabolism and the feeding patterns of inhabiting populations. Based on the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbance provides important trophic constraints that influence the trophic niches of local communities, stable isotopes analysis was used to evaluate possible alterations in resource assimilation by aquatic species in response to diffuse and point sources of pollution from the city of Rome. For this purpose, the isotopic signature (15N and 13C) of detritus-based benthic communities and fish was determined upstream and downstream of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located before and after the urban stretch of the river Tiber. Community-wide metrics as the carbon range and convex hull area encompassing all taxa in a 15N and 13C bi-plot were used to measure the species' niche width and overlap. Differences were found between the upstream and downstream signatures, regarding the 15N and 13C of both detritivores and predators. The differences were found to be more pronounced at the southern WWTP, located downstream of the city. The lower 15N in macroinvertebrates at the WWTP-impacted sites reflected the lower 15N of suspended particulate organic matter and was associated with higher inorganic and organic loads. The decreasing range of 13C values in macroinvertebrates and fish indicated a narrowing of the niche width downstream of the treatment plants, particularly downstream of the urban area itself. The effects were stronger on detritivores than predators due to direct incorporation of the sewage-derived material that dominated the locally available food sources. These data suggest that isotopic signals coupled with community-wide metrics can be used as functional indicators of treated and untreated sewage impacts on aquatic communities even when the primary targets (species abundance and community structure) appear to be largely unaffected. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We conducted a broad-scale analysis of Delta delta N-15 and Delta delta C-13 from aquatic systems, including three new field estimates. Carnivores had significantly higher Delta delta (15N) values than herbivores. Furthermore, carnivores, invertebrates, and lab-derived estimates were significantly more variable than their counterparts (f-test, p {\textless} 0.00001). Delta delta C-13 was higher for carnivores than for herbivores (p = 0.001), while variances did not differ significantly. Excluding herbivores, the average Delta delta N-15 and Delta delta C-13 were 3.4 parts per thousand and 0.8 parts per thousand, respectively. But even with unbiased fractionation estimates, there is variation in isotopic fractionation that contributes to error in quantitative isotope model outputs. We simulated the error variance in Delta delta N-15-based estimates of trophic position and two-source delta C-13 diet mixing models, explicitly considering the observed variation in Delta delta N-15 and Delta delta C-15, along with the other potential error sources. The resultant error in trophic position and mixing model outputs was generally minor, provided that primary consumers were used as baseline indicators for estimating trophic position and that end member delta C-13 values in dietary mixing models were sufficiently distinct.},

Such baseline variation in δ15N is difficult to resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the δ15N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that δ15N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in δ15N likely reflects the high δ15N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline variation in δ15N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied. Our results also suggest that the δ15N signatures of nitrogen at the base of the loud chain will provide a useful tool in the assessment of anthropogenic nutrient inputs.},

We conducted an extensive review of the literature (66 publications) concerning estimates of animal-diet Δ13C (n = 290) and Δ15N (n = 268). We analysed this data set to test the effect of diet isotopic ratio on the discrimination factor, taking into account taxa, tissues, environments and lipid extraction treatments. Our results showed differences among taxonomic classes for Δ13C, but not for Δ15N, and significant differences among tissues for both Δ13C and Δ15N. We found a significant negative relationship between both, Δ13C and Δ15N, with their corresponding diet isotopic ratios. This relationship was found also within taxonomic classes for mammals (Δ13C and Δ15N), birds (Δ13C), fishes (Δ13C and Δ 15N) and invertebrates (Δ13C and Δ15N). From these relationships, we propose a method to calculate discrimination factors based on data on diet isotope ratios (termed the 'Diet-Dependent Discrimination Factor', DDDF). 3. To investigate current practice in the use of discrimination factors, we reviewed studies that used multi-resource isotopic models. More than 60\% of models used a discrimination factor coming from a different species or tissues, and in more than 70\% of models, only one Δ13C or Δ15N was used for all resources, even if resources had very different isotopic ratios. Also, we estimated DDDFs for the studies that used isotopic models. More than 40\% used Δ15N values and more than 33\% used Δ13C values differing {\textgreater} 2‰ from estimated DDDFs. 4. Synthesis and applications. Over the last decade, applied ecologists have discovered the potential of stable isotopes for animal diet reconstruction, but the successful adoption of the method relies on a good estimation of discrimination factors. We draw attention to the high variability in discrimination factors, advise caution in the use of single discrimination factors in isotopic models, and point to a method for obtaining adequate values for this parameter when discrimination factors cannot be measured experimentally. Future studies should focus on understanding why discrimination factors vary as a function of the isotopic value of the diet. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},
